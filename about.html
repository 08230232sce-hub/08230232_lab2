      <h2>Hello! I'm Ugyen Tenzin</h2>
      <p>I am Ugyen Tenzin currently studying at Samtse College of Education, I was born on 4 October 2003 in the serene village of Younphula, within Kanglung Gewog of Trashigang Dzongkhag, Bhutan.Growing up amid the rolling hills and crisp mountain air of this eastern region, I developed a deep appreciation for community life and the natural beauty that surrounds my hometown. These early experiences continue to inspire my learning journey and shape the values I carry into everything I do. I grew up in a warm and close-knit family of six. We are four siblings—my eldest brother leads the way, followed by my caring elder sister and another loving sister, with me as the youngest.I am a student passionate about technology and education. I enjoy exploring new tools, solving problems, and designing meaningful digital experiences.</p>
      <p>My goal is to contribute to ICT education and create engaging digital learning projects.</p>
